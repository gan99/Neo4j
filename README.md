Request for Confirmation of Completion – Security Education Requirements
Dear Security Education Team,
I hope this message finds you well.
Could you kindly confirm whether I have completed all the necessary requirements for Security Education? I’ve been informed that if any mandatory steps remain outstanding, I may face disconnection from all applications effective September 26th.
I would appreciate it if you could provide written confirmation at your earliest convenience so I can ensure everything is in order.
Thank you for your support.
Best regards,
Ganesh
