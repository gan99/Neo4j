Subject: Meeting Minutes & Action Plan â€“ NACB UEN Review and UI Enhancement

Hi Team,

Hereâ€™s a quick summary of our discussion and next steps from todayâ€™s meeting:

ðŸ§© Key Discussion Points

NACB Data â€“ Same Name but Different UENs

We identified cases in the NACB dataset where the same party name appears with multiple UENs.

Action:

Check the NACB data for shared or connected UENs linked to the same parent entity.

If these are indeed connected to the same parent, itâ€™s valid to have different names but different UENs for those parties.

Document the logic clearly for consistency across mappings.

Missing Clients in NACB for UEN Mapping

Some clients are not listed in NACB, which causes gaps in UEN mapping.

Action:

First, check the current monthâ€™s reports to verify if the client appears there.

If not, check the previous monthâ€™s reports for any occurrence.

If the client still doesnâ€™t appear in either, reach out to the source team to confirm data availability or source discrepancies.

UI Enhancement â€“ Context Expansion Data Table

Proposal to create a new UI table component that dynamically populates the data being expanded in context (Client â†’ Account â†’ Payment â†’ FI â†’ Prospect).

Action:

Build a UI table that captures and displays the nodes and relationships for the currently expanded client context.

The table should update interactively as users expand or collapse nodes in the visualization.
